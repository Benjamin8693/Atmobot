# Atmobot
Bot created for use of The Atmoplex, for their Discord server and Twitter. I am not affiliated with The Atmoplex- this bot was created for fun and as a hobby project, then later on handed off to the Atmoplex team for their own implementation. Atmobot can handle new revisions of Wizard101, and spoil files of interest automatically. There are also a selection of commands, most of which are just-for-fun.

API keys were committed during the early development of this project- they have all been reset now that the project is open-source.

This will remain a solo project, but feel free to submit a pull request if you'd like.

Please do NOT submit any issues or ask for support, as it will not be provided.

I understand some of the code here may not be the best, but I went through quite a learning curve with this project- so please go easy on me!
